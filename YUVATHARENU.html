     <h2 class="dearuv">DEAR UV,</h2>
     <p class="why">You're a great person that people really want to get inspired.Not sure how others feel and think of you,but, I have learned and still learning many
      things from you.Being "yourself" is the bravest thing a person can do. Because, nowadays, people want to do bad things 
      but still want to hold a good name. While, people who are being themselves will be labeled as the most evil people among them. But when a person can be 
       themselves without caring what others people going to judge about them, no one can beat that person in this world. Just like you.
       I'm not sure why you sometimes feel sad but don't be sad so much anymore. you don't deserve that sadness.I'm not sure if you realize 
       it or not, but you've done a lot of good things for us. One of the secrets of my
        success must be you. Without you, I wouldn't get a good grade actually. You've helped a lot, I just don't know how to reciprocate. you. </p>

     There will definitely have up and down but i know you can overcome it.You're a queen to be honest.Not gonna lie,i was at the begining being your 
     friend was like:"she's

     (i'm okay if you wanna hate me after this,hahahah)but honestly,it doesnt matter how i feel but when my mum ask me the question how was uv and i always tell her"uv.
